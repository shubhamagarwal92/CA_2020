# CA_2020
Material for the Conversational Agents Course.

Slides for the `English Teacher` project are in `project_material` folder.

### Preparation:

- Git - Check this [gist](https://gist.github.com/shubhamagarwal92/012034f23fc04a00897d8bd24a39f740) if you dont have git installed already.
- I highly recommend installing PyCharm as Python IDE (especially if you are on Windows). Go on the [website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and download the `Community` version which is open-sourced and free. 
- I highly recommend installing `Anaconda for Python3`. Follow the instructions mentioned [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for your platform.

#### Anaconda installation 

If you are not able to install following the instructions mentioned on the Anaconda website, I have created this simple `install_conda.sh` bash script. (Tested for Ubuntu and Mac). Run the bash script as: 

```
bash install_conda.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

Mac users can run `source ~/.bash_profile` instead of `source ~/.bashrc` 

Check you have conda installed by listing the current environments:

`conda env list`

Now you can create an environment as:

`conda create --name test_env python=3.6 -y`
